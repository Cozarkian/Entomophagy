# Entomophagy
Eat Bugs Yum

Adds an entomophagous (bug eater) trait. Pawns with this trait enjoy eating bugs and gain a positive mood thought from eating insect meat. If entomophagous pawns are hungry, undrafted, unhurt, haven't recently eaten bugs, and the weather is nice, they may decide to randomly forage for bugs on their own for ~1-2 hours. Similar to mental breaks, pawns cannot be controlled or drafted while foraging. Pawns will stop foraging if they are hurt or the whether turns bad. Foraging for live bugs causes a slight negative opinion in other pawns.

Adds "insect" versions of vanilla meals and Vanilla Cooking Expanded foods. You can decide whether the new textures appear automatically when cooking with insect meat, whether to add specific insect-meal bills to cooking stations (restart required), both, or neither.

A new bug hotel and bug condo provides a method for creating a stable supply of insect meat at the cost of resources.
